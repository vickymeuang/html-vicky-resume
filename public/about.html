    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a Seasoned Senior Quality Assurance Manager with over 15 years' experience honed 
      across various industries including corporate lodging, online educational programs, healthcare 
      communication, transportation and telematics solutions . Recognized for my strategic leadership, 
      I excel at bridging the gap between QA, engineering, and product management teams to ensure the 
      timely delivery of high-quality products. My collaborative agility allows me to mentor and guide 
      high-caliber teams on QA best practices, significantly accelerating the time to market while 
      championing continuous improvement through leveraging automated testing tools.</p>

    <p>Over the course of my professional journey, I have spearheaded numerous successful 
  initiatives that have enhanced testing efficiency, reduced time to market, and optimized 
  processes. At Hotel Engine, Inc., I directed testing strategies for international product launches, 
  streamlined testing processes, and played a key role in reducing defect resolution time. 
  Earlier, at Edmentum, Inc., I significantly fast-tracked a testing strategy for a pivotal
   migration project to AWS, scaling the application to support over 150K concurrent users. 
   My efforts at Spok, Inc. included establishing an automation team, standardizing QA processes, 
   and mentoring a dozen on-site and remote engineers. Throughout my roles, I've been dedicated to 
   promoting quality, reducing manual testing, and ensuring high-quality software delivery through 
   creative solutions and process improvements.</p>

    <p>I thrive in environments that value collaborative effort and creative solutions. My experience,
    coupled with a passion for mentoring and guiding teams, equips me to make meaningful contributions 
    to any project. I am excited about the prospect of leveraging my skills and experiences to contribute
    to future teams, driving quality assurance excellence, and helping organizations achieve their strategic
    objectives.</p>
